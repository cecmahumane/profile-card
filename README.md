## Overview

Users should be able to:

- Observe the use of HTML and CSS to create a profile card that could be used in a social media site.


## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

 In the future many of these could be integrated into a single page, perhaps with an effect on hover to indicate that card is a about to be clicked.
